Every device manufacturer should provide a manifest specifying the translation from the reporting format for each device to the API standard fields.

The manifest is a json that must include two fields: _'metadata'_ and _'field_mapping'_

The metadata header must include the version of the manifest, the version of the API, a signature, a list of the models that it applies to, and the source data type (json, xml or csv).

`{
  "metadata" : {
    "version" : "1.0.0",
    "signature" : "12345",
    "device_models" : ["GX4001", "GX4002"],
    "source_data_type": "json"
  }
}`

The field mapping is an array of elements that describe the translation between a reported value and an API value.

Each of these elements must include:

* _target_field_ - the name of the field inside CDP, using json path.

* _type_ - 'integer', 'string' or 'enum'. Indicates the type of the value that will be indexed.

* _core_ - boolean. Indicates that the field is part of the API.

* _indexed_ - boolean. Indicates that the field will be returned when querying the API.

* _pii_ - boolean. Indicates if the field must be considered PII or not.

* _options_ - Only required for 'enum' fields. It's an enumeration of possible values:
`"options" : [0, 1]`

* _valid_values_ - if the field is not a PII field, and is a custom field, a scoped definition of values must be provided in order to prove that it's not PII. This values could be:
  * _range_ - a range of values, specified through 'min' and 'max' elements.
  `"valid_values": {
      "range" : {
          "min" : 0,
          "max" : 100
      }
  }`

  * _date_ - a date format that this field should follow. Eg: 'iso', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'
  `"valid_values": {
      "date" : "iso"
  }`

* _source_ - the path and transformations to be applied to the reported value to match the API standards.
  * _lookup_ - expects the source path of the reported field, using json path if the source_data_type is json: for multiple elements the [*] notation must be used; for each nesting level, the depth is specified using a period (.). In this case, the element 'test_result' has a field named 'conditions' that contains an array, and for every element of this array, the element 'name' is taken.
  `"source" : {
      "lookup" : "test_result.conditions[*].name"
  }`

  * _map_ - expects the element to transform as the first parameter and an array of transformations as the second one. If a match applies, the result will be the output specified. Wildcards are specified as '*'.
  `"source" : {
      "map": [
          {"lookup" : "conditions[*].condition"},
          [
              {"match": "*MTB*", "output" : "MTB"},
              {"match": "*FLU*", "output" : "H1N1"},
              {"match": "*FLUA*", "output" : "A1N1"}
          ]
      ]
  }`

  * _convert_time_ - it will convert a numeric time from a given time unit to another one specified. The source time unit is expected first. Possible units are: years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds. When reducing the unit precision, no rounding will be made. When converting from days to years, all years will be considered as 365.25 days long. When converting from days to months, all months will be considered as 30 days long.
  `"source" : {
      "convert_time" : [{"path" : "patient_information.age_in_years"}, "years", "days"]
  }`

  * _beginning_of_ [year, month] - Useful for date related PII, it converts a date into a less specific time span. Expects the value as the first parameter, and the time unit as the second one.
  `"source" : {
      "beginning_of" : [{"lookup" : "patient_information.age"}, "month"]
  }`

  * _milliseconds_between_ / _hours_between_ / _minutes_between_ / _seconds_between_ / _years_between_ / _months_between_ / _days_between_ - measures the number of milliseconds, hours, years, etc. between two given dates. Useful to compute ages or test durations. It will allways round to the smallest value.
  `"source" : {
      "years_between" : [
          {"lookup" : "patient_information.birth_date"},
          {"lookup" : "test_information.run_at"}
      ]
  }`

  * _clusterise_ - given an array of steps and a number, it returns the bucket that contains it. The lower boundary will allways be zero and the upper bucket will allways contain all the values that are greater or equal the last step value. The step value will allways be the greater value of the generated cluster. In the following example, the buckets created will be: "0-5", "6-15", "16-45", "46+"
  `"source" : {
      "clusterise" : [
          {"lookup" : "patient_information.age_in_years"},
          [5,15,45]
      ]
  }`

  * _substring_ - it extracts the string in the specified positions. Negative values are counted from the end of the string being -1 the last element. The given example will return the original string untouched.
  `"source" : {
      "substring" : [{"lookup" : "test_information.assay_code"}, 0, -1]
  }`

  * _concat_ - expects two or more parameters and returns a string containing all the parameters joined
  `"source" : {
      "concat" : [
          {"lookup" : "patient_information.last_name"},
          ", ",
          {"lookup" : "patient_information.first_name"}
      ]
  }`

  * _strip_ - removes trailing spaces from the given parameter
  `"source" : {
      "strip" : {"lookup" : "patient_information.last_name"}
  }`

  * _parse_date_ - parse the value of the field using the specified format for further processing. Eg: 'iso', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'. If the value is to be stored as a date, there is no need to parse it. This is useful when the result is a calculation that must be applied to a given date in a strange format.
  `"source" : {
      "parse_date" : [{"lookup" : "patient_information.birth_date"}, "%d-%m-%Y %I:%M:%S %p"]
  }`
