Every device manufacturer should provide a manifest specifying the translation from the reporting format for each device to the API standard fields.

The manifest is a json that must include two fields: _'metadata'_ and _'field_mapping'_

The metadata header must include the version of the manifest, the version of the API, a signature, a list of the models that it applies to, and the source data type (json, xml or csv).

`{
  "metadata" : {
    "version" : "1.0.0",
    "signature" : "12345",
    "device_models" : ["GX4001", "GX4002"],
    "source_data_type": "json"
  }
}`

The field mapping is an array of elements that describe the translation between a reported value and an API value.

Each of these elements must include:

* _target_field_ - the name of the field inside CDP, using json path.

* _type_ - 'integer', 'string' or 'enum'. Indicates the type of the value that will be indexed.

* _core_ - boolean. Indicates that the field is part of the API.

* _indexed_ - boolean. Indicates that the field will be returned when querying the API.

* _pii_ - boolean. Indicates if the field must be considered PII or not.

* _options_ - Only required for 'enum' fields. It's an enumeration of possible values:
`"options" : [0, 1]`

* _valid_values_ - if the field is not a PII field, and is a custom field, a scoped definition of values must be provided in order to prove that it's not PII. This values could be:
  * _range_ - a range of values, specified through 'min' and 'max' elements.
  `"valid_values": {
      "range" : {
          "min" : 0,
          "max" : 100
      }
  }`

  * _date_ - a date format that this field should follow. Eg: 'ISO', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'
  `"valid_values": {
      "date" : "iso"
  }`

* _source_ - the path and transformations to be applied to the reported value to match the API standards.
  * _lookup_ - expects the source path of the reported field, using json path if the source_data_type is json: for multiple elements the [*] notation must be used; for each nesting level, the depth is specified using a period (.). In this case, the element 'test_result' has a field named 'conditions' that contains an array, and for every element of this array, the element 'name' is taken.
  `"source" : {
      "lookup" : "test_result.conditions[*].name"
  }`

  * _map_ - expects the element to transform as the first parameter and an array of transformations as the second one. If a match applies, the result will be the output specified. Wildcards are specified as '*'.
  `"source" : {
      "map": [
          {"path" : "conditions[*].condition"},
          [
              {"match": "*MTB*", "output" : "MTB"},
              {"match": "*FLU*", "output" : "H1N1"},
              {"match": "*FLUA*", "output" : "A1N1"}
          ]
      ]
  }`

  * _convert_time_ - it will convert a numeric time from a given time unit to another one specified. The source time unit is expected first. Possible units are: years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds.
  `"source" : {
      "convert_time" : [{"path" : "patient_information.age_in_years"}, "years", "days"]
  }`

  * _beginning_of_ [year, month] - Useful for date related PII, it converts a date into a less specific time span. Expects the time unit as the first parameter and the value as the second one.
  `"source" : {
      "beginning_of" : [{"path" : "patient_information.age"}, "month"]
  }`

  * _milliseconds_between_ - measures the number of milliseconds between two given dates. Useful to compute ages or test durations.
  `"source" : {
      "milliseconds_between" : [
          {"path" : "patient_information.birth_date"},
          {"path" : "test_information.run_at"}
      ]
  }`

  * _clusterise_ given an array of clusters and a number, it returns the bucket that contains it. The first and last cluster may contain only one element and it will represent the upper or lower boundary of the bucket, allowing the other to be the maximum or minimum possible value.
  `"source" : {
      "clusterise" : [
          {"path" : "patient_information.age_in_years"},
          [
              [5],
              [6, 15],
              [16, 45],
              [46]
          ]
      ]
  }`

  * _substring_ - it extracts the string in the specified positions
  `"source" : {
      "substring" : [{"path" : "test_information.assay_code"}, 0, 5]
  }`

  * _concat_ - expects two or more parameters and returns a string containing all the parameters joined
  `"source" : {
      "concat" : [
          {"path" : "patient_information.last_name"},
          ", ",
          {"path" : "patient_information.first_name"}
      ]
  }`

  * _strip_ - removes trailing spaces from the given parameter
  `"source" : {
      "strip" : {"path" : "patient_information.last_name"}
  }`
