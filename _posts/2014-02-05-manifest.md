Every device manufacturer should provide a manifest specifying the translation from the reporting format for each device to the API standard fields.

The manifest is a json that must include two fields: _'metadata'_ and _'field_mapping'_

The metadata header must include the version of the manifest, the version of the API, a signature, a list of the models that it applies to, and the source data type (json, xml or csv).

`{
  "metadata" : {
    "version" : "1.0.0",
    "signature" : "12345",
    "device_models" : ["GX4001", "GX4002"],
    "source_data_type": "json"
  }
}`

The field mapping is an array of elements that describe the translation between a reported value and an API value.

Each of these elements must include:

* _target_field_ - the name of the field inside CDP, using json path.
* _type_ - 'core' or 'custom'. Indicates that the field is part of the API.
* _multiple_ - boolean. Indicates that the field is inside an array.
* _pii_ - boolean. Indicates if the field must be considered PII or not.
* _valid_values_ - if the field is not a PII field, and is a custom field, a scoped definition of values must be provided in order to prove that it's not PII. This values could be:
  * _range_ - a range of values, specified through 'min' and 'max' elements.
  `"valid_values": {
      "range" : {
          "min" : 0,
          "max" : 100
      }
  }`

  * _options_ - an enumeration of possible values
  `"valid_values" : {
      "options" : [0, 1]
  }`

  * _date_ - a date format that this field should follow. Eg: 'ISO', 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'
  `"valid_values": {
      "date" : "iso"
  }`

* _source_ - the path and transformations to be applied to the reported value to match the API standards.
  * _path_ - the source path of the reported field, using json path if the source_data_type is json: for multiple elements the [*] notation must be used; for each nesting level, the depth is specified using a period (.). In this case, the element 'test_result' has a field named 'conditions' that contains an array, and for every element of this array, the element 'name' is taken.
  `"source" : {
      "path" : "test_result.conditions[*].name"
  }`

  * _mapping_ - expects the value as the first parameter and an array of transformations as the second one.
  `"source" : {
      "mapping": [
          {"path" : "conditions[*].condition"},
          [
              {"match": "*MTB*", "output" : "MTB"},
              {"match": "*FLU*", "output" : "H1N1"},
              {"match": "*FLUA*", "output" : "A1N1"}
          ]
      ]
  }`

  * _days_in_ - expects the time unit as the first parameter and the value as the second one.
  `"source" : {
      "days_in" : ["month", {"path" : "patient_information.age"}]
  }`

  * _concat_ - expects two or more parameters and returns a string containing all the parameters joined
  `"source" : {
      "concat" : [{"path" : "patient_information.last_name"}, ", ", {"path" : "patient_information.first_name"}]
  }`
